  aboutTitle: Hey there,
  aboutContent: I am Giorgi. I have created Hygge and Clay in 2020. During the first lockdown, I decided to give it a try and set up my new creative space. Hygge and Clay was created with the aim to bring my art to life. After traveling in South America and Africa, I understood the importance of bright colours which I try to recreate when I make my pieces.
